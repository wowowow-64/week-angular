# Project Blueprint: Angular To-Do App

## Overview

This document outlines the design, features, and implementation plan for a modern to-do list application built with Angular. The application will showcase the latest features of the Angular framework, including standalone components, signals for state management, and the new built-in control flow syntax.

## Style, Design, and Features

### Visual Design

*   **Aesthetics:** A clean, minimalist design with a focus on usability and a great user experience.
*   **Layout:** A responsive, single-page layout that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Color Palette:** A simple and elegant color scheme with a primary accent color for interactive elements.
*   **Typography:** Clear and readable fonts to enhance usability.
*   **Iconography:** Modern and intuitive icons to guide the user.

### Core Features

*   **Add To-Do:** A clear and accessible input field to add new to-do items.
*   **List To-Dos:** A well-organized list of all to-do items.
*   **Complete To-Do:** The ability to mark to-do items as complete with a satisfying visual indicator.
*   **Filter To-Dos:** The ability to filter the to-do list to show all, active, or completed items.
*   **Delete To-Do:** The ability to remove to-do items from the list.
*   **Local Storage:** To-do items will be persisted in the browser's local storage so they are not lost on page reload.

## Phase 1: The Core To-Do Experience

This initial phase focuses on building the fundamental features of the to-do application.

*   **Generate the main `todo` component.**
*   **Style the main app component to act as a container.**
*   **Create a `TodoService` to manage the state of the to-do items using signals.**
*   **Implement the UI to display the list of to-do items.**
*   **Implement the functionality to add new to-do items.**
*   **Implement the ability to mark to-do items as complete.**
